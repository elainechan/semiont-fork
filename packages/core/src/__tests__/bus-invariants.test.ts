/**
 * Bus channel-classification invariants — the cross-list consistency contract.
 *
 * A bus channel carries several independent properties, each declared in a
 * different place:
 *   - emittable  — non-null `CHANNEL_SCHEMAS` entry → `EmittableChannel`
 *                  (validated by the `/bus/emit` gateway).        bus-protocol.ts
 *   - bridged    — transports subscribe to it over SSE → `BridgedChannel`.
 *                                                                 bridged-channels.ts
 *   - persisted  — logged to the event store, replayable → `PersistedEventType`.
 *                                                                 persisted-events.ts
 *   - scoped     — delivered on a resource-scoped bus →
 *                  `RESOURCE_SCOPED_CHANNELS` (derived in @semiont/http-transport).
 *
 * The bugs that motivated these guards were all *cross-list* inconsistencies,
 * not within-list ones:
 *   - a reply channel missing from BRIDGED_CHANNELS → silent 30 s timeout
 *     (.plans/bugs/gather-resource-complete-not-bridged.md);
 *   - a channel in *both* BRIDGED and the scoped set → double delivery
 *     (.plans/bugs/BRIDGE-GAPS.md).
 *
 * Each list is now guarded at compile time by an `as const satisfies
 * readonly EventName[]` clause (BRIDGED_CHANNELS, PERSISTED_EVENT_TYPES,
 * RESOURCE_BROADCAST_TYPES) or `satisfies Record<EventName, …>`
 * (CHANNEL_SCHEMAS) — so a typo'd or stale channel name is a build error. This
 * file pins the remaining invariants the type system can't express: array shape
 * (no duplicates) and cross-list set relations.
 *
 * NOT checked here: "every reply channel is bridged." A channel must be bridged
 * iff it has a *remote* (SSE/HttpTransport) consumer, which is encoded only in
 * `busRequest` calls — and those already constrain their result/failure channels
 * to `BridgedChannel` at compile time. Reply-*named* channels whose only
 * consumers are in-process are correctly unbridged (e.g. `yield:move-failed`: the
 * CLI `mv` command has no remote SDK surface, so nothing remote awaits it), so a
 * name-based scan would be all false positives. Turning "is a remote reply" into
 * data is the Tier 1 operations-registry step.

/**
 * The Tier-1 migration safety net. `BRIDGED_CHANNELS` is now DERIVED from
 * `BUS_OPERATIONS` (every op's result/failure/progress) plus `BRIDGED_BROADCASTS`
 * — see .plans/BUS-OPERATIONS-REGISTRY.md. This frozen snapshot is the exact set
 * the old hand-list carried (minus the reaped dead `gather:annotation-finished`).
 * If an operation is ever missed or mistyped, the derived set diverges from this
 * snapshot and the test goes red — so no reply channel can silently drop. Edit
 * this snapshot ONLY for a deliberate, reviewed change to the bridged set.
