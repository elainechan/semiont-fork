/**
 * Bus logging — runtime-toggleable cross-wire visibility.
 *
 * One line per event that crosses a process boundary, in a grep-able
 * format that's symmetric across frontend and backend:
 *
 *   [bus EMIT] <channel> [scope=X] [cid=<first8>] <payload>
 *   [bus RECV] <channel> [scope=X] [cid=<first8>] <payload>
 *   [bus SSE]  <channel> [scope=X] [cid=<first8>] <payload>
 *
 * Tier 1 of `.plans/OBSERVABILITY.md`. Forward-compatible with Tier 2:
 * the `cid` printed here is exactly the prefix of the W3C trace-id we
 * adopt later.
 *
 * Cost when disabled: one property read per call, zero allocations.
 *
 * Enable:
 *   - Browser:  `window.__SEMIONT_BUS_LOG__ = true` (DevTools or e2e init)
 *   - Node:     `SEMIONT_BUS_LOG=1` in the process env (read at module load)
