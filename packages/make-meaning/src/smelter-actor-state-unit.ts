/**
 * SmelterActorStateUnit — domain-event fan-in for the Smelter worker.
 *
 * Subscribes to the six smelter-relevant channels on a shared bus and
 * exposes them as a single typed `events$` stream. Transport-neutral —
 * the caller passes a `WorkerBus` (HTTP `ActorStateUnit` today, an in-process
 * bus shim if/when one exists). The state unit does not own the bus and does
 * not dispose it.
 *
 * `start()` widens the bus's channel-subscription set to include the
 * smelter channels. On HTTP this extends the SSE subscription URL;
 * on an in-process bus this is a no-op (the underlying `EventBus`
 * already delivers every emit).
