/**
 * LocalTransport — `ITransport` for an in-process `KnowledgeSystem`.
 *
 * Bus-ownership pattern (see `docs/protocol/TRANSPORT-CONTRACT.md`):
 *   - The caller owns a make-meaning `EventBus` and passes it to both
 *     `startMakeMeaning` and `LocalTransport` so the transport can publish
 *     directly onto the bus the `KnowledgeSystem` actors are listening on.
 *   - `SemiontClient` constructs its own `clientBus` and calls
 *     `bridgeInto(clientBus)` during construction. `LocalTransport`
 *     subscribes to every `BRIDGED_CHANNELS` entry on the make-meaning bus
 *     and forwards each onto `clientBus`.
 *   - The bus reference flows client → transport, never the other way.
 *
 * LocalTransport implements `ITransport` only. Auth, admin, and exchange
 * (`IBackendOperations`) are HTTP-shaped concepts that don't apply
 * in-process — local mode runs as a single host-process identity supplied
 * at construction, with no token/credential lifecycle. A `SemiontClient`
 * built over this transport has no `.auth` / `.admin` namespaces.
