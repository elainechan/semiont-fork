The TypeScript SDK for [Semiont](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont) — a programmable surface for **collaborative knowledge work**. Whether you're building a browser app where humans annotate documents and propose links, an AI agent that gathers context and matches candidate references, a daemon that ingests new sources, or a one-shot script that queries an established knowledge base, you reach the same verb namespaces, the same collaboration primitives, the same lifecycle observables.

The eight flows — *frame, yield, mark, match, bind, gather, browse, beckon* — describe what participants *do* when they work with a shared corpus. The first seven act on content; Frame acts on the schema layer (the conceptual vocabulary the others operate within). The SDK exposes them uniformly across surfaces. A human in a browser hovers an annotation; an AI agent at the other end of the bus sees the hover and reacts; a daemon ingests new text and every connected participant sees the corpus grow live. Humans and AI agents are peers — the SDK does not distinguish.

The SDK is **transport-agnostic**: it consumes the `ITransport` and `IContentTransport` contracts from [`@semiont/core`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/tree/main/packages/core). For HTTP backends, the canonical wire adapter is re-exported here for convenience. For in-process operation (CLI, agentic worker, embedded use), use `LocalTransport` from [`@semiont/make-meaning`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/tree/main/packages/make-meaning).

> **Where this doc fits.** This README is the *typed-surface reference* — what's in `@semiont/sdk`, how the namespaces are organized, what return shapes to expect. For the *protocol-level architectural framing* (the eight flows, the three programmable surfaces — CLI, SDK, Skills — the core tenets, the per-flow contracts), start with [`docs/protocol/README.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/docs/protocol/README.md). Daemon authors stitching multiple packages together also want the [skill packs](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/tree/main/docs/protocol/skills) — `semiont-session` for watcher daemons, `semiont-worker` for job-claim daemons, `semiont-wiki` for the end-to-end annotation pipeline.

## Four ideas that hold the surface together

The SDK is wider than a typical client library because the domain is — collaborative knowledge work over a shared corpus, with humans and AI agents as peers. Four framings make the API tractable; once you've seen them, the rest is predictable.

### 1. Eight verbs

Every operation in the SDK belongs to one of eight *flows* — verbs that describe what a participant *does* with a shared corpus. The flows are the entire vocabulary of the protocol; learn them once and the surface stays small.

| Verb | What it does | Example methods |
|---|---|---|
| **frame** | Define and evolve the schema vocabulary (entity types, tag schemas, future relation types) | `frame.addEntityType`, `frame.addEntityTypes`, `frame.addTagSchema` |
| **yield** | Introduce new resources into the system | `yield.resource`, `yield.fromAnnotation`, `yield.cloneToken` |
| **mark** | Add structured metadata to resources | `mark.annotation`, `mark.assist`, `mark.archive` |
| **match** | Search the corpus for candidate resources | `match.search` |
| **bind** | Resolve ambiguous references to specific resources | `bind.body`, `bind.initiate` |
| **gather** | Assemble related context around an annotation | `gather.annotation` |
| **browse** | Navigate, read, and observe | `browse.resource`, `browse.annotations`, `browse.entityTypes`, `browse.tagSchemas`, `browse.click` |
| **beckon** | Coordinate attention across participants | `beckon.hover`, `beckon.attention`, `beckon.sparkle` |

Each flow is a namespace on `SemiontClient` (`client.mark.X(...)`, `client.gather.X(...)`, ...). The verb is the unit of mental model — a method call belongs to a flow, not to a noun. Frame is the schema-layer flow — content flows operate within the vocabulary Frame manages. Per-flow contracts live in [`docs/protocol/flows`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/tree/main/docs/protocol/flows).

### 2. One call, two ways to consume

Most data-fetching libraries make you choose between Promise-shaped and Observable-shaped at the import line. The SDK doesn't. Every long-lived value comes back as an `Observable` that *also* implements `PromiseLike<T>` — `await` it for the final value, `.subscribe(...)` it for progress events or live updates, from the same call.

```ts
// One-shot consumer — never imports rxjs
const resource = await client.browse.resource(rId);
const result   = await client.match.search(rId, refId, ctx);

// Reactive consumer — same call, .subscribe instead of await
client.browse.resource(rId).subscribe((r) => {
  if (r === undefined) showSkeleton();
  else render(r);
});
client.match.search(rId, refId, ctx).subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.kind === 'progress') updateProgress(event.data);
});
```

A script that just wants the final value never imports anything from `rxjs`. A browser app rendering loading state subscribes to the same shape. The reactive substrate is preserved as a load-bearing architectural choice; the user-facing surface looks Promise-shaped when that's all the caller needs.

Methods return one of: `Promise<T>` (atomic backend ops), an awaitable `Observable<T>` subclass (`StreamObservable<T>` for bounded progress streams, `CacheObservable<T>` for live queries with stale-while-revalidate), or `void` (collaboration signals — see #3). Per-method assignments and the typing discipline are in [`docs/REACTIVE-MODEL.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/REACTIVE-MODEL.md).

### 3. Collaboration primitives

The `void`-returning third category — collaboration signals — is the SDK's distinctive contribution to multi-participant coordination. They look fire-and-forget at the call site; on the bus they fan out across every participant.

A human in a browser hovers an annotation (`beckon.hover(annotationId)`); an AI agent at the other end of the bus sees `beckon:hover` and reacts. An agent emits a sparkle (`beckon.sparkle(annotationId)`); the human's UI lights up the indicated annotation. A frontend state unit emits `mark.changeShape('rectangle')`; a different participant subscribed to `mark:shape-changed` reacts.

This is *protocol-level* coordination — not browser-app fluff, not bolted-on presence — and it sits on the same typed namespace surface as data operations. Observers reach the same signals via `session.subscribe(channel, handler)` or `client.bus.get(channel)`. Three legitimate paths to the bus are documented in [`docs/REACTIVE-MODEL.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/REACTIVE-MODEL.md#three-paths-to-the-bus).

### 4. Transport agnosticism

`SemiontClient` is constructed against the `ITransport` and `IContentTransport` interfaces from `@semiont/core` — not against any particular wire. The same SDK surface runs over HTTP, in-process, or any future transport that satisfies the interface. None of the eight verb namespaces or the flow state machines reach for transport-specific features.

```ts
// HTTP — connect to a remote backend
const client = await SemiontClient.signInHttp({ baseUrl, email, password });

// In-process — same surface, no network
const client = new SemiontClient(localTransport, localContentTransport);
```

`KnowledgeBase` carries a uniform shape regardless of transport (only the nested `endpoint` varies — `{ kind: 'http', host, port, protocol }` or `{ kind: 'local', kbId }`). Code that doesn't *construct* transports — your scripts, the verb namespaces, the flow state machines — never inspects which kind it has. Tests can run against an in-process transport for speed; daemons can embed the backend; the same domain code drives both.

## What's in the box

- **`SemiontClient`** — the verb-oriented coordinator over a wire transport.
- **Verb namespaces** — `frame`, `browse`, `mark`, `bind`, `gather`, `match`, `yield`, `beckon`, `job`, `auth`, `admin`. Typed methods that wrap the bus protocol; consumers never touch raw channel strings.
- **Collaboration primitives** — fire-and-forget signals on the verb namespaces (`beckon.hover`, `bind.initiate`, `mark.changeShape`, `browse.click`, ...) coordinate attention and intent across participants. Not afterthoughts, not browser-app fluff: they're how a multi-participant session stays coherent.
- **Session layer** — `SemiontSession` (per-KB authentication, token refresh, lifecycle), `SemiontBrowser` (multi-KB orchestration), and `SessionStorage` adapters (`InMemorySessionStorage`, plus a browser-backed one in `@semiont/react-ui`).
- **Flow state machines** — RxJS-based factories (`createMarkStateUnit`, `createGatherStateUnit`, `createMatchStateUnit`, `createYieldStateUnit`, `createBeckonStateUnit`) that wrap each long-running flow with `loading$` / `error$` / progress observables. UI-shape-agnostic — any consumer (browser, terminal, mobile, daemon) can subscribe.
- **`WorkerBus`** — the transport-neutral channel-bus interface that worker-side adapters consume. Domain-specific worker adapters live with their domain — `createJobClaimAdapter` in [`@semiont/jobs`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/tree/main/packages/jobs); `createSmelterActorStateUnit` in [`@semiont/make-meaning`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/tree/main/packages/make-meaning) — and consume `WorkerBus` from here.
- **Helpers** — `bus-request` (correlation-ID request/reply), the cache primitive backing live queries, and `createSearchPipeline` (debounced-search RxJS pipeline).

Page-shaped state machines (admin tables, compose page, resource viewer page, etc.) live in [`@semiont/react-ui`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/tree/main/packages/react-ui), alongside the components that render them. Those are framework-neutral but tied to the Semiont web frontend's specific page taxonomy; they don't apply to non-web consumers.

## For non-web consumers (TUI, mobile, daemon, agent)

`@semiont/sdk` is the only package a non-web Semiont consumer needs. From it you get:

- `SemiontClient` + the eight verb namespaces (`frame`, `browse`, `mark`, `bind`, `gather`, `match`, `yield`, `beckon`)
- Three infrastructure namespaces (`auth`, `admin`, `job`) when constructed with backend operations
- `SemiontSession` for long-running token refresh + persistence
- `SemiontBrowser` for multi-KB orchestration (transport-agnostic; takes a `SessionFactory`)
- The five flow state machines above
- The transport-neutral `WorkerBus` interface (worker adapters live in their domain packages — `@semiont/jobs`, `@semiont/make-meaning`)
- Branded ID types, the unified error hierarchy (`SemiontError`, `BusRequestError`), and the neutral `TransportErrorCode` vocabulary — all re-exported from `@semiont/sdk` so you catch every SDK error from one package.

Nothing page-shaped, nothing web-shell-shaped. A TUI, mobile reader, daemon, or AI agent installs `@semiont/sdk` alone (plus a transport package — `@semiont/http-transport` for HTTP, `@semiont/make-meaning` for in-process).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @semiont/sdk
```

## Quick start (HTTP)

For one-shot scripts, `SemiontClient.signInHttp(...)` is the credentials-first one-line construction:

```ts
import { SemiontClient } from '@semiont/sdk';

const semiont = await SemiontClient.signInHttp({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4000',
  email: 'me@example.com',
  password: 'pwd',
});

const resources = await semiont.browse.resources({ limit: 10 });
console.log(resources);

semiont.dispose();
```

For long-running scripts that need to survive token expiry, use `SemiontSession.signInHttp(...)` — same credentials shape, plus proactive refresh, validation, storage-adapter wiring, and disposal. `kb` is required; its `id` is the storage key for this session, so distinct scripts must use distinct ids:

```ts
import { SemiontSession, InMemorySessionStorage, type KnowledgeBase } from '@semiont/sdk';

const kb: KnowledgeBase = {
  id: 'my-watcher',
  label: 'My Watcher',
  email: 'me@example.com',
  endpoint: { kind: 'http', host: 'localhost', port: 4000, protocol: 'http' },
};

const session = await SemiontSession.signInHttp({
  kb,
  storage: new InMemorySessionStorage(),
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4000',
  email: 'me@example.com',
  password: 'pwd',
});

// session.client is the same SemiontClient surface; the session manages
// the token$ lifecycle around it (default refresh callback wired automatically).
const resources = await session.client.browse.resources({ limit: 10 });

await session.dispose();
```

`KnowledgeBase` is uniform regardless of transport kind; the variation lives in the nested `endpoint` (currently `{ kind: 'http', host, port, protocol }` or `{ kind: 'local', kbId }`). Code that doesn't construct transports — your scripts, the verb namespaces, the flow state machines — never inspects `endpoint`.

If you already have an access token (CLI cached-token path, env-var token, embedded auth flow), use `SemiontClient.fromHttp({ baseUrl, token })` or `SemiontSession.fromHttp({ baseUrl, token, storage, kb, refresh, ... })` to skip the auth round-trip.

## Quick start (in-process)

When you want the SDK without an HTTP backend — e.g. in a CLI, a unit test, or an Electron-style desktop app — wire `LocalTransport` directly to a knowledge system:

```ts
import { SemiontClient } from '@semiont/sdk';
import {
  startMakeMeaning,
  LocalTransport,
  LocalContentTransport,
} from '@semiont/make-meaning';

const ks = await startMakeMeaning(project, config, eventBus, logger);
const transport = new LocalTransport({
  knowledgeSystem: ks.knowledgeSystem,
  eventBus,
  userId,
});
const client = new SemiontClient(
  transport,
  new LocalContentTransport(ks.knowledgeSystem),
);
```

Same `SemiontClient`, same verb namespaces — no network involved. There is no `fromLocal` factory because the in-process transport's dependencies (knowledgeSystem, eventBus, userId) are not boilerplate the SDK can hide.

## Worked examples

The eight verb namespaces hang off `SemiontClient`, plus three infrastructure namespaces (`auth`, `admin`, `job`) when the client was constructed with backend operations. Each example below uses one of the return shapes mentioned above; the per-method assignment table is in [`docs/REACTIVE-MODEL.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/REACTIVE-MODEL.md#method-by-method-assignment).

```ts
// Browse — live queries; await yields the loaded value, subscribe yields
// loading-then-loaded.
const resources = await client.browse.resources({ limit: 10 });
client.browse.resource(resourceId).subscribe(/* ... */);

// Mark / Bind — atomic operations return Promise<T>.
// `mark.annotation` takes the W3C-shaped input directly; the resourceId
// is derived from `input.target.source` and returned as a branded id.
const { annotationId } = await client.mark.annotation(annotationInput);
await client.bind.body(rid, aid, [{ op: 'add', item: { /* W3C body */ } }]);

// Gather / Match — bounded streams; await yields the final value, subscribe
// yields every progress emission.
const ctx = await client.gather.annotation(rid, aid);
client.match.search(rid, refId, ctx, { limit: 10 }).subscribe(/* ... */);

// Yield — author new resources. Returns an UploadObservable; await yields
// { resourceId }, subscribe yields the upload-progress lifecycle.
const { resourceId } = await client.yield.resource({
  name, file, format, storageUri,
});

// Beckon, Bind, Browse, Mark — collaboration signals (void). Fire-and-
// forget; fan out to other participants over the bus.
client.beckon.hover(annotationId);
client.bind.initiate({ annotationId });
client.browse.click(annotationId, 'linking');
```

The verb-by-verb walkthroughs live in [docs/protocol/flows](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/tree/main/docs/protocol/flows). The per-namespace API reference with concrete examples for each method lives in [`docs/Usage.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/Usage.md).

- [`docs/STATE-UNITS.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/STATE-UNITS.md) — the foundational pattern behind the flow state machines, worker adapters, and search pipeline: closure-based factories, RxJS-shaped surface, dispose lifecycle, and the axioms every new state unit honors.
- [`docs/CACHE-SEMANTICS.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/packages/sdk/docs/CACHE-SEMANTICS.md) — the cache primitive's behavioral contract.
- [`docs/protocol/TRANSPORT-CONTRACT.md`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/docs/protocol/TRANSPORT-CONTRACT.md) — the transport interface every `ITransport` must honor.

## Behavioral contract

The guarantees every `ITransport` implementation must honor — what `subscribe()` does on disconnect, what `LastEventId` replay must look like, what `puts` must be idempotent — are documented in [docs/protocol/TRANSPORT-CONTRACT.md](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/docs/protocol/TRANSPORT-CONTRACT.md). HTTP-specific guarantees (the `/bus/emit` gateway, SSE reconnect, `Last-Event-ID` replay window) live in [docs/protocol/TRANSPORT-HTTP.md](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/semiont/blob/main/docs/protocol/TRANSPORT-HTTP.md).

When implementing a new transport (gRPC, WebSocket, IPC, …), implement those interfaces from `@semiont/core` directly — there is no inheritance from `HttpTransport`.
