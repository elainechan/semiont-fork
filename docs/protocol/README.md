# Semiont Protocol

Semiont is infrastructure for **collaborative knowledge work** — humans and AI agents working as peers on a shared corpus, possibly across rooms or cities, possibly across time. The protocol is the contract that makes that collaboration possible: a uniform set of **eight composable flows** — frame, yield, mark, match, bind, gather, browse, beckon — that every participant speaks, regardless of whether they're a person reading a document in a browser, an AI agent proposing references, a script ingesting new sources, or a daemon worker doing background analysis. Anything that conforms to the protocol can act as a peer; the knowledge base does not distinguish between humans and AI agents.

Knowledge work isn't only data processing. It's interpretation, attention, debate, framing, citation — actions that depend on knowing what your collaborators are doing and why. Semiont's protocol is shaped accordingly: alongside the CRUD-shaped flows there are first-class **collaboration primitives** (`beckon:hover`, `mark:shape-changed`, `bind:initiate`, ...) that let participants observe each other's intent and attention as it happens. Multi-participant coordination isn't bolted on top of a data-processing API — it's woven into the protocol from the bottom.

This page covers the design tenets, the value proposition, and the three programmable surfaces (CLI, SDK, Skills) every participant uses.

## Why Semiont

Semiont transforms unstructured content into interconnected semantic networks, stored as portable, structured annotations anchored to source passages. Self-hosted, so your data stays on your infrastructure. Inference runs on **Anthropic** (cloud) or **Ollama** (local) — mix providers per worker to balance cost, capability, and privacy.

**Eliminate Cold Starts** — Import a set of documents and the eight flows immediately begin producing value: AI agents detect entity mentions, propose annotations, and generate linked resources while humans review, correct, and extend the results. The knowledge graph grows as a byproduct of annotation — no upfront schema design, manual data entry, or batch ETL pipeline required.

**Calibrate the Human–AI Mix** — Because humans and AI agents share identical interfaces, organizations can dial the mix to fit their constraints. A domain with abundant expert availability and a high accuracy bar can run human-primary workflows with AI suggestions; a domain rich in GPU capacity but short on specialists can run agent-primary pipelines with human spot-checks. Supervision depth, automation ratio, and quality gates are deployment decisions — not architectural rewrites.

**Coordinate Across Participants** — A room of analysts working with three AI agents on a multimodal corpus needs more than synchronized state. They need to see who's currently looking at what, who's proposing a binding, what an agent is sparkling as a candidate match. Semiont treats those signals as protocol-level events on the shared bus, not local UI state — so a participant in another city, a worker across an SSE connection, or an agent running in-process all see them and can react.

## Core Tenets

**Peer Collaboration** — Humans and AI agents are architectural equals. Every operation — read, write, **and coordination signal** — flows through the same API, event bus, and event-sourced storage regardless of who initiates it. Any workflow can be performed manually, automated by an agent, or done collaboratively, in any mix and at any scale.

**Document-Grounded Knowledge** — Knowledge is always anchored to source documents. Annotations point into specific passages; references link documents to each other. The knowledge graph is a projection of these grounded relationships, not a replacement for the original material.

**Coordination is First-Class** — `beckon:hover`, `mark:shape-changed`, `bind:initiate`, `browse:click` and the rest of the collaboration signals fan out to every connected participant. They aren't browser-app UI noise — they're how multi-participant work stays coherent. A human's hover can drive an agent's relevance scoring; an agent's sparkle can direct a human's attention. The protocol exposes them at the same level as data operations.

**[Eight Collaborative Flows](flows/README.md)** — humans and AI agents work as peers through eight composable workflows:

- **[Frame](flows/FRAME.md)** — Define and evolve the KB's schema vocabulary — what *kinds* of things exist (entity types, future tag schemas, relation types). The schema layer the other seven flows operate within
- **[Yield](flows/YIELD.md)** — Introduce new resources into the system — upload documents, load pages, or generate new content from annotated references
- **[Mark](flows/MARK.md)** — Add structured metadata to resources — highlights, assessments, comments, tags, and entity references — manually or via AI-assisted detection
- **[Match](flows/MATCHER.md)** — Search the knowledge base for candidate resources using multi-source retrieval and composite scoring — structural signals plus optional LLM re-ranking
- **[Bind](flows/BIND.md)** — Resolve ambiguous references to specific resources, linking entity mentions to their correct targets in the knowledge base
- **[Gather](flows/GATHER.md)** — Assemble related context around a focal annotation for downstream generation or analysis
- **[Browse](flows/BROWSE.md)** — Navigate through resources, panels, and views — structured paths for reviewing and examining content
- **[Beckon](flows/BECKON.md)** — Direct user focus to specific annotations or regions of interest through visual cues and coordination signals

The eight flows are also the eight verb namespaces on the SDK's `SemiontClient` (`client.frame.X(...)`, `client.yield.X(...)`, `client.mark.X(...)`, `client.match.X(...)`, ...). The protocol's vocabulary and the typed namespace surface are 1:1 — learn the flows once, read the SDK with no further translation. The collaboration signals from "Coordination is First-Class" appear on the same namespaces as `void`-returning methods (`beckon.hover`, `mark.changeShape`, `bind.initiate`, `browse.click`); see [`packages/sdk/README.md`](../../packages/sdk/README.md#three-ideas-that-hold-the-surface-together) for the SDK-side framing.

## Automate

Every operation in the GUI is available programmatically. The same eight flows work identically whether driven by a human, a script, or an AI agent.

**[Semiont CLI](../../apps/cli/README.md)** — pipe the full annotation pipeline from the terminal:

```bash
semiont mark doc-123 --delegate --motivation linking --entity-type Person --entity-type Organization
semiont gather annotation doc-123 ann-456
semiont match doc-123 ann-456
semiont bind doc-123 ann-456 target-789
```

**[Semiont SDK](../../packages/sdk/README.md)** — type-safe TypeScript SDK organized by the eight verbs. `SemiontClient.signInHttp(...)` is the credentials-first one-line construction for scripts. Long-running scripts that span token expiry use `SemiontSession.signInHttp(...)` instead — same shape, plus refresh and persistence.

The SDK is RxJS-native — live queries and progress streams are real Observables — but its return values implement `PromiseLike<T>`, so `await semiont.X.Y(...)` works directly without learning RxJS. Reach for `.subscribe(...)` only when you want progress events or live updates, and `.pipe(...)` only when you want operator composition. The deeper guides live alongside the package: **[Usage.md](../../packages/sdk/docs/Usage.md)** is the per-namespace tour, **[REACTIVE-MODEL.md](../../packages/sdk/docs/REACTIVE-MODEL.md)** explains the Promise-shape-over-Observable design, and **[CACHE-SEMANTICS.md](../../packages/sdk/docs/CACHE-SEMANTICS.md)** is the live-query cache contract.

```typescript
import { SemiontClient } from '@semiont/sdk';

const semiont = await SemiontClient.signInHttp({ baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4000', email, password });

await semiont.mark.assist(resourceId, 'linking', { entityTypes: ['Person'] });
const { response: context } = await semiont.gather.annotation(resourceId, annId);
const results = await semiont.match.search(resourceId, refId, context);
await semiont.bind.body(resourceId, annId, [{ op: 'add', item: { type: 'SpecificResource', source: targetId } }]);
```

**[Agent Skills](skills/)** — ready-made skill definitions that agentic coding assistants like Claude Code can use to drive the full pipeline without writing integration code.
